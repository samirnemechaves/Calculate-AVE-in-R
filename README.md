# Calculate-AVE-in-R
Function to calculate Average variance extracted (AVE) with R 
To obtain the Average variance extracted (AVE) it is indispensable to have a model in Lavaan previously built before being able to use the condisc function.

I have not created the function I have only taken it from my script and I have made it available, it is the one I have always used and so far I have had no problems with it, just change the name of the model and the corresponding setting example: condisc(fit2) or condisc(fit3) to give the new result.
However if you want more information from the original creator of the function you can visit the following url: https://github.com/ihrke/astatur/blob/master/R/condisc.R
